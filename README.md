# Bathroom-Dashboard
A simple Python/Flask web app that shows **live bathroom availability** based on a school bell schedule.   Bathrooms are automatically marked **CLOSED** during the first and last 15 minutes of class, and **OPEN** during all other times (passing periods, breaks, lunch, and mid-class windows).
