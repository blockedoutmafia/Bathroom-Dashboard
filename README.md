Bathroom Status Dashboard

This project is a lightweight, offline-friendly web dashboard for schools to display bathroom availability in real time. Built with Flask, it shows a live clock, current status (OPEN/CLOSED), next change time, and daily open windows. An admin panel (PIN-protected) allows schedules to be edited directly in the browser or uploaded via CSV, making it simple to adapt to bell changes without touching code.

Bathrooms are automatically marked CLOSED during the first and last 15 minutes of class, and OPEN during all other times (passing periods, breaks, lunch, and mid-class windows).

Designed to run on a Mac (or any computer with Python) and displayed on a Chromebook in kiosk mode for students and staff.
